# SciTool
Welcome to SciTool!
This app is designed to help users graph, calculate, and simulate otherwise tedious tasks.

The list of available SciTools is below, and this list is always growing!
If you want to contribute a SciTool, please send me an email at starfleetcaptain676@gmail.com

2. 3D Potential Graph
3. Circuit Simulator
4. Stoichiometry Reaction Solver
5. Stoichiometry Mass Solver
6. Stellar Properties Solver
7. Binary System Solver
8. RR Lyrae Variable Calculator

(credit for 4,5 goes to @thegail for his Swift 5 command line project [Stoichiometry](https://github.com/thegail/Stoichiometry))

(6,7,8 can also be found in the [StarCalc](https://github.com/mdnich/starcalc) project)

Current Dependencies: Must have Python3 installed and must have the following packages:
