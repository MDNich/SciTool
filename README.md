# SciTool
Welcome to SciTool!

This app is designed to help users graph, calculate, and simulate otherwise tedious tasks.

This branch is written in Java rather than Swift, and so will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux (hopefully). It is still in development.

To get a stable version of SciTool, or learn more about it, use the main branch.
