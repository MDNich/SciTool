/**
 * Wrapper for {@link io.scif.Metadata}. Used to create defensive copies of
 * metadata for manipulation by {@link io.scif.filters.ReaderFilter}s, while
 * allowing for API modification if needed.
 * <p>
 * If a Reader-based {@code Filter} requires special functionality from its
 * Metadata, a companion MetadataWrapper can be implemented. Concrete
 * implementations of this interface should always be annotated with
 * {@code Plugin} so they can be dynamically found when constructing new
 * {@code Filters}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: This interface duplicates the Metadata setter signatures, with the
 * addition of a {@code passUp} flag. If this flag is true, the wrapped metadata
 * will also have the corresponding value set. If not, only the wrapper will be
 * modified.
