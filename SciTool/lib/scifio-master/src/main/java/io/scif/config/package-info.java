/**
 * This package provides configuration options for all SCIFIO components.
 * <p>
 * Configuration is achieved through use of the
 * {@link io.scif.config.SCIFIOConfig} class. Methods in this class are prefixed
 * based on what component they are modifying. The {@code SCIFIOConfig} then
 * operates as a single container of state, passed between each consumer, which
 * queries the values that apply to them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Configuration is scoped within method execution, thus SCIFIOConfig objects
 * should not be cached, but instead always passed through method signatures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Adding new configuration options requires three steps:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Add the appropriate field(s) and setter/accessor methods to
 * {@code SCIFIOConfig}.</li>
 * <li>Modify the class being configured to accept {@code SCIFIOConfig} objects
 * and query the desired information.</li>
 * <li>Update any downstream code of the newly configurable class to pass along
 * {@code SCIFIOConfig} objects.</li>
 * </ul>
