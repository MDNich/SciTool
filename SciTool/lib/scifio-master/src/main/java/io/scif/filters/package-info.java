/**
 * Provides wrapping classes for modifying the performance of one or more of a
 * {link io.scif.Format}'s components.
 * <h3>Changes since Bio-Formats</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implemented SCIFIO {@link io.scif.filters.Filter}s. Filters are designed
 * to wrap arbitrary classes. An implementation is currently provided for
 * Readers: {@link io.scif.filters.ReaderFilter}.
 * <p>
 * Filters are analogous to the ReaderWrappers of Bio-Formats, but function a
 * bit differently. In Bio-Formats, you would create a stack of ReaderWrappers
 * based on what functionality you wanted to add to a given Reader instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In SCIFIO, the Filters are discoverable plugins (via the scijava-common
 * Context). When you create a ReaderFilter (e.g. via
 * {@link io.scif.services.InitializeService#initializeReader}) you get the
 * whole stack of discovered plugins. Each can be individually configured to be
 * enabled by default. This allows dynamic extensibility, as new Filters can be
 * added to the classpath and automatically discovered and enabled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ReaderFilter is then passed around and functions like a normal Reader.
 * But as plugins are enabled and disabled within the Filter, it automatically
 * maintains the stack (based on each Filter's priority), obviating the need for
 * user knowledge of a construction order.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Future plans</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement Filters for the remaining component types.</li>
 * </ul>
