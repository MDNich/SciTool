/**
 * Provides {@link io.scif.Format} implementations for all file formats that are
 * supported by default in SCIFIO.
 * <p>
 * The set of default formats are all open formats that can be freely read and
 * written, to facilitate the inclusion of SCIFIO as an image IO library in
 * external projects.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Changes since Bio-Formats</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>In Bio-Formats, image input and output was separated by Reader and Writer
 * classes. Although these classes still exist in SCIFIO, some operations have
 * been split out (especially from the Reader) to other components. All of these
 * classes are collected under a single {@link io.scif.Format} as nested
 * classes.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Future plans</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Convert the remaining open source formats (in the scifio component,
 * loci.formats.in and loci.formats.out) to SCIFIO Formats.</li>
 * </ul>
