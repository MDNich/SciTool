/**
 * An entry point for toggling and configuring {@link Filter}s.
 * <p>
 * When instantiated, all appropriately typed {@code Filter} classes should be
 * discovered by this class. As {@link #enable(Class)} and
 * {@link #disable(Class)} are called on the appropriate {@code Filter} classes,
 * a stack of filters is built.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: this interface extends {@link Filter} and concrete {@code MasterFilter}
 * implementations should similarly extend the interface they wrap. However,
 * instead of {@link io.scif.filters.Filter#getParent()} returning the wrapped
 * object, it should return the head of this {@code MasterFilter}'s filter
 * stack.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: all wrappers should be maintained as singletons within the scope of a
 * {@code MasterFilter} instance, so that {@link #enable(Class)} returns the
 * same filter instance each time it is called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: {@code MasterFilters} are intended to be used the same way as
 * {@code Filters}: that is, as the wrapped component would be. However, the
 * {@code Filter} API does have a slightly different meaning in the context of a
 * {@code MasterFilter}.
