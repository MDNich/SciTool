/**
 * Provides reference management utilities.
 * <p>
 * The {@link io.scif.refs.RefManagerService} provides a dedicated thread for
 * polling reference queues, looking for available references. The
 * {@link io.scif.refs.RefManagerService#manage(Object, Object[])} method is
 * used to create and enqueue a new reference. The first parameter is the object
 * to manage, and it must have a corresponding {@link io.scif.refs.RefProvider}
 * that matches the given {@code Object[]} parameter list.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link io.scif.refs.RefProvider} is a new plugin type for generating
 * references, and is uniquely defined by the target referent plus an additional
 * set of parameters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link io.scif.refs.CleaningRef} interface is provided for references that
 * have clean-up operations after being enqueued.
 * </p>
