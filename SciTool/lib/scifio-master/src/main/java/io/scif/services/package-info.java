/**
 * Provides a set of Services (singletons within a given context) for working
 * with SCIFIO objects.
 * <h3>Changes since Bio-Formats</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Removed {@code services.txt}. A text file maintaining the current
 * services is prohibitive to external development, as per {@code readers.txt}
 * in {@link io.scif}. Instead, all services are now managed through the
 * scijava-common {@link org.scijava.Context}. New services should be annotated
 * using {@link io.scif.SCIFIOService}.</li>
 * <li>As the old ServiceFactory paradigm has been removed, this package has
 * been generalized to contain services that plug into the scijava-common
 * context. New services should follow an interface/implementation paradigm, and
 * use the {@link org.scijava.service.Service} annotation.</li>
 * </ul>
