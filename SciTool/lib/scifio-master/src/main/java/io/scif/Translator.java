/**
 * Interface for all SCIFIO {@code Translators}.
 * <p>
 * Multiple {@code Translators} can be defined for a given {@code Format}. Each
 * encodes a process for converting from one {@link io.scif.Metadata} type to
 * another (where either the source or the destination is the {@code Metadata}
 * type associated with this {@code Format}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #translate(Metadata, Metadata)} method always accepts an instance
 * of both source and destination {@code Metadata}. This allows chaining of
 * multiple translators (or other methods) to populate a single instance of
 * {@code Metadata}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If no {@code Metadata} instance is readily available for translation, it can
 * be created through the {@code Format}, and existing {@code Metadata}
 * instances can be reset to ensure no previous information persists.
